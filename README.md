# Cubico
## Important
Please do not edit existing prefabs and scripts. These are used as is in the live game. If you want to change a Prefab then save it as a Prefab variation and if you want to edit a script I suggest to create a copy of the existing and update the prefab variation with your modified script.

Keep your content tidy, create a subfolder in Community-Content with your name and put all your work in there.
